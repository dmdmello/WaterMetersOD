1) In order to run the notebook ObjectRecognition.ipynb in its entirety, you will either have to decompress the .zip file "images_preprocessed.zip" or you will have to move the original "TLKWaterMeters/images/" folder into "TLKWaterMeters/" in this project, and follow the notebook instructions for preprocessing the original images.

2) The model whose training is described in the notebook is saved in "training_outputs/model_pretrained/obj_rec_model.pth"
